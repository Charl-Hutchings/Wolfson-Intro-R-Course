## Vectors and data types 

R has many structures in which data can be stored and manipulated: 

* Vectors
* Data frames
* Matrices
* Lists
* Factors
<br>
<br>

The most common and basic of these structures is a vector, sometimes referred to
as an **atomic vector**. Whilst vectors can be used as a structure in themselves, 
they are also the basic building blocks of several other data types, as we will 
see later.
<br>
<br>

A vector is simply a collection of values. These values can any of the 6 basic
data types in R: 

1. **character** = a series of letters, numbers and/or punctuation marks (a **string**). Always found between quotation marks (single or double) e.g., `"a"`, `"fish"`, `"3.14"`. If a number is found in quotation marks, R will interpret this data as being of type character, not numeric. This is important because R cannot then use this data in a numeric manner i.e., to carry out arithmetic. 
2. **double** = one of the two **numeric** data classes in R, standing for *double precision floating point numbers*. This means any real number, an integer or a decimal (10, 3.14, 1.45765, 10000, 5)
3. **integer** = the second of the two **numeric** data classes in R, holding only integer values e.g., 5L (the "L" tells R to store this as an integer rather than double)
4. **logical** = a `TRUE`, `FALSE` class
5. **complex** = complex numbers with real and imaginary parts
6. **raw** = holds raw bytes

Data types 5 and 6 are rarely used and will not be covered in this workshop.
As outlined above, **numeric** data in R can be stored as either **double** or 
**integer**. You don't need to worry about this because R will automatically 
convert between these classes when required for mathemetical purposes. There is
really no need to explicitly state or know which or the two **numeric** classes
the data is.
<br>
<br>

A *vector* is a collection of values **of the same data class**. You can 
visualise a vector like this: 


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Vectors_in_R.jpeg", error = FALSE)
```
<br>


To create a vector we use the `c()` function, where `c` stands for combine. 
We pass the function our values, each separated by ",".


```{r}
## Create a numeric vector and assign to the object weight_g
weight_g <- c(50, 60, 57, 82)
```


This is a numeric vector. We can also create a character vector.


```{r}
## Create a character vector and assign to the object molecules
molecules <- c("dna", "rna", "protein")
```
<br>

**Question:**
What happens if we try to create a character vector but forget to include our
values in quotation marks?


```{r, eval = FALSE}
## What if we forget our quotation marks?
molecules <- c(dna, rna, protein)
```
<br>
<br>


**Exploring vectors**

There are several key functions that allow us to find out information about a
vector. The `class()` and `length()` functions will tell us what data class is
stored within a vector and how many data elements there are.


```{r}
## Check class and length of weight_g
class(weight_g)
length(weight_g)
```
<br>

**Question:** 
What will be the outputs of `class` and `length` when we pass our `molecules`
vector?


To get both of these pieces of information at the same time we can use the `str()`
function, standing for structure.


```{r}
## Check the structure of weight_g
str(weight_kg)
```
<br>
<br>

**Indexing vectors**

Sometimes we might wish to access only certain elements of a vector. To do this
we need to introduce the concept of *indexing*. The term *indexing* refers to 
selecting a subset of elements. To do this, we use square brackets and provide
one or more indices. 


```{r}
## Return the first element in the weight_g vector
weight_g[1]

## Return the third element in the weight_g vector
weight_g[3]

## Return all elements between positions 1 and 3 in weight_g
weight_g[1:3] ## Based on a sequence
weight_g[-4] ## Using the minus sign to ask for all except 4
```
<br>

**Question:** 
How could we index multiple elements that are not together in a sequence. For 
example, if I only wanted elements 1 and 3 from `weight_g`?
<br>

We can also do more complex indexing based on conditions (**conditional indexing**).
For instance, if we wanted to return the element "rna" from our `molecules` 
vector but we don't remember which position it is in.


```{r}
## Index all elements in molecules that are "rna"
molecules[molecules == "rna"]
```


We can also do this for numeric vectors using mathematic operators. Let's try
to subset elements from our `weight_g` vector that have a value greater than 55.


```{r}
## Index all elements in weight_g that are > 55
weight_g[weight_g > 55]
```


We can combine multiple conditions use the `&` (and) and `|` (or) operators.


```{r}
## Index all elements in weight_g that are > 55 and < 80
weight_g[weight_g > 55 & weight_g < 80]

## Index all elements in weight_g that are > 55 or < 80
weight_g[weight_g > 55 | weight_g < 80]
```
<br>

**Question:**
What is actually happening behind the scenes when we do conditional indexing?
Think about the data classes. See what happens if we execute the condition
outside of the indexing.


```{r}
weight_g > 55
```
<br>

**Question:**
Why does `"four" > "five"` return `TRUE`? What is happening in this conditional 
statement?


```{r}
"four" > "five"
```
<br>
<br>

**Coercing vectors into a single data class**

One of the primary features of a vector is that it represents a linear collection
of elements that **must** be of the same data class. Above we looked at both 
numeric and character vectors. If we try to create a vector with multiple data
classes, R will automatically **coerce** the elements into a single data type.


```{r}
## Try to generate a vector with multiple data classes
mixed_vector <- c("dna", 12, 45, "rna", 77)

str(mixed_vector)
```


The numeric values have been coerced into character values, which we can see 
from (i) the `chr` and presence of quotation marks.
<br>

**Question:**
What is the hierarchy which R uses for the coercion of different data types?
Try generating vectors with:

1. Character and numeric values = coerced to... 
2. Character and logical values = coerced to...
3. logical and numeric values = coerced to...

For more information about coercion behavior in R see [here](https://www.zigya.com/blog/what-is-coercion-in-r/).

It is important to know what data class you are dealing with because this will 
influence what you can and cannot do with the data. We can convert the data type
of a vector to a different class using the "as" family of functions:

* `as.character()`: convert to character type data
* `as.numeric()`: convert to numerical vector
* `as.integer()`: convert to integer vector
* `as.logical()`: convert to logical vector
<br>
<br>

**Vectorization in R** 

Most of R's functions are **vectorized** meaning that the function will operate 
on each element of the vector. This makes coding more concise, easier to read, 
and less prone to errors.


```{r}
## Vectorized function - function applied to all elements of a vector independently
weight_g * 5
```
<br>
<br>

**Factor vectors**

R has a special way of dealing with categorical data - the **factor**. 
Categorical data might be something such as sex - "Male", "Female" - or tumour
stage - "Stage1", "Stage2", "Stage3", etc. Critically, the possible entries, or
**levels**, of a factor are limited. 

While factors look and behave like character vectors, they are actually stored
by R as an integer vector, so it is important to be careful with them when
treating them as strings or transforming them to other data types.

We can convert a character vector into a factor using the `factor()` function.
Let's try this with our `molecules` vector.


```{r}
## Convert molecules vector into a factor
molecules <- factor(molecules)

## Check structure
str(molecules)
```


We now have a factor with each category stored as a level. As mentioned above, 
R treats the levels of a factor as integers, here 1, 2 and 3. These integers 
are assigned to the levels alphabetically, which is not necessarily the order in
which we specified them. We can check the order of our levels using the `levels()`
function.


```{r}
## Check levels
levels(molecules)
```


These are returned in alphabetical order. For plotting or statistical analysis, 
the order of the levels will sometimes matter. If we want to re-order the levels
of a factor we can make use of the `levels` argument of the `factor()` function.


```{r}
## Create a factor and specify level order
molecules <- factor(x = molecules, levels = c("dna", "rna", "protein"))

## Check
levels(molecules)
```


Alternatively, we can over-write the pre-existing levels of a factor like so:


```{r}
## Re-order the levels of a factor
levels(molecules) <- c("protein", "dna", "rna")

## Check
str(molecules)
```


Factor vectors can be converted back to numeric or character classes using the
`as.numeric()` and `as.character()` functions.
<br>
<br>

**Challenge: Vectors in R**
<br>
Create a new vector called `heights` with the following values: 63, 69, 60, 65, 
NA, 68, 61, 70, 64, NA, 72, 65. Use the `median()` function to determine the
median of these values. Remember that you can use `?median` to ask for help 
using this function. After this, use R to determine how many people in the set 
are taller than 67 inches.


<details>  
<summary>Solution</summary> 
<br>

```{r}
heights <- c(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 64, NA, 72, 65)

median(x = heights) ## gives NA
median(x = heights, na.rm = TRUE) ## gives 65

heights > 67
which(heights > 67)
length(which(heights > 67))

```

</details>
<br>

## Data frames

Vectors are arguably the most important base structure in R. However, most of the
time we want to store multiple data variables of different data types in a single
object. That is where data frames come in. A *data frame* is a simple tabular 
structure in which the columns are vectors of the same length. Since a data frame
contains multiple vectors it is able to store data of multiple different classes.

A data frame is the most similar structure in R to a standard spreadsheet.


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Data_frame_in_R.png", error = FALSE)
```
<br>

We can generate a data frame from vectors of the same length using the `data.frame()`
function. Let's create a data frame containing information about Cambridge Students.


```{r}
## Create vectors that will become columns (all must be the same length)
sex <- c("male", "female", "female", "male", "female")
height_cm <- c(175, 165, NA, 168, 178)
college <- c("Wolfson", "Kings", "Lucy Cavendish", "St.Catherines", "Wolfson")

## Combine vectors into a single data frame
students <- data.frame(sex, height_cm, college)

## Check the structure
str(students)
```
<br>
<br>

**Inspecting data frames**

In addition to `str`, there are many functions that can be used to inspect the
data stored within a `data.frame`.

* `dim()` = returns a vector in which the first element is the number of rows and the second element is the number of columns
* `nrow()` = returns the number of rows
* `ncol()` = returns the number of columns
* `head()` = displays all columns of the first 6 rows
* `tail()` = displays all columns of the last 6 rows
* `names()` or `colnames()` = returns the column names
* `rownames()` = returns the row names
* `summary()` = provides summary statistics for each column
<br>
<br>

**Indexing data frames**

We already learnt how to subset information from a vector by indexing. Now we 
are going to extend this to subsetting information from a data frame. The main
difference here is that, unlike 1 dimensional vectors, data frames have 2 
dimensions (the rows and columns). Hence, we need to provide two indices in our
square brackets - `[row, column]`.


```{r}
## First element in the first column of the data frame
students[1, 1]

## Second element in the first column of the data frame
students[2, 1]

## Second element in the third column of the data frame
students[2, 3]
```


If we leave one of the indices empty, the default is to give us everything.


```{r}
## All elements in the second column of the data frame
students[, 2]

## The first element in all columns of the data frame
students[1, ]
```


As before, we can also exclude certain indices of the data frame using the "-"
sign.


```{r}
## All columns except the third
students[, -3]
```


In addition to the indexing we saw with vectors, data frames can also be indexed
using the column names directly:


```{r}
## Subset using column names as indices
students[, "sex"]
students$sex
```


One can use `&` (and), `|` (or) and `!` (not) logical operators for complex
subsetting, as we saw before for vectors.

## Matrices 

The final data structure we are going to meet in this workshop is a **matrix**.
Like data frames, matrices are two dimensional - they have both rows and columns.
Unlike data frames, however, matrices can only store one data type: `numeric`, 
`logical` or `character`. In that respect, matrices are more similar to a vector.

To generate a matrix we use the `matrix()` function. This function takes a vector
of values (of any single data type) to populate the matrix with and the number
of rows and columns that this should be divided into. The values are filled in 
column-by-column. 


```{r}
## Create a 3x3 matrix containing the values 1 to 9
(example_matrix <- matrix(1:9, ncol = 3, nrow = 3))


## Create a 3x2 matrix containing the character values 1 to 6
values <- c("one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six")
(example_matrix_2 <- matrix(values, ncol = 2, nrow = 3))
```


A matrix can be indexed in the same way as a data frame, using `[row, col]`.


```{r}
## First element in the second column of a matrix
example_matrix[1, 2]
```


Matrices are commonly used in statistical analyses and modelling. If we have a
data frame containing only numerical information and wish to convert this into 
a matrix we can do so using the `as.matrix()` function.
